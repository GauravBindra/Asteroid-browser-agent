# Premises Handler Issues

Based on the analysis of logs12.md, here are the key issues that need to be addressed in the premises handler implementation:

## 1. Date Field Error Handling Issue
- **Problem**: At line 641-648, there's an error when filling the "Year Of Construction" field with value "1998". The `convert_date` function in `date_helpers.py` expects a date string in format "yyyy-mm-dd" but receives just "1998".
- **Details**: Our code tries to unpack the date string with `year, month, day = date_str.split("-")` but fails when there are no hyphens.
- **Solution**: Enhance the `convert_date` function to handle various date formats, including single year values.

## 2. Field Dependencies Location Issues
- **Problem**: At lines 702-703 and 713-715, fields that should be processed based on the "hasFlatRoof" value are being skipped because the `should_process_field` function is checking against incorrect section names.
- **Details**: It shows `Skipping field 'percentageOfFlatRoof' - field is in section 'Premises Construction', not in current section 'Premises Details'` when we're actually in the right section.
- **Solution**: Update the FIELD_DEPENDENCIES configuration to match the correct section names used in the code.

## 3. Scrolling Error Handling
- **Problem**: At lines 731-770 and 781-826, we encounter errors with scrolling. The agent tries to scroll down when it's already at the bottom of the page, causing an error.
- **Details**: The agent throws an error when it can't scroll further, which disrupts the field detection process.
- **Solution**: Add error handling for scrolling operations in the field_exists function to catch and properly manage these errors.

## 4. Missing Fields in the Form
- **Problem**: Several fields from our JSON data don't exist in the actual form.
- **Details**: Fields like "Have Cold Stores", "Rebuilding Cost", "Roof Last Relaid", "Any Composite Panels", "Warehouse Floor Area", "Is Building Purpose Built", and "Is Undergoing Building Works" aren't found.
- **Solution**: Add logic to gracefully skip missing fields without affecting the overall completion status of the section.

## 5. Subsection Section Mismatch
- **Problem**: The code identifies fields in the subsection correctly but dependency checking is using the wrong section names.
- **Details**: Our FIELD_DEPENDENCIES config may have inconsistent section names compared to what we're using in the code.
- **Solution**: Standardize section naming across both the dependency configuration and the handler code.

## Next Steps
1. Fix the date handling function to handle various date formats
2. Update the field dependencies configuration with correct section names
3. Improve error handling for scrolling operations
4. Enhance field detection to better handle missing fields
5. Standardize section naming throughout the codebase
