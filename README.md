# Asteroid Form Challenge

This repository contains a solution for the Asteroid Form Challenge, which aims to automate the filling and submission of web forms.

## Project Overview

The project is being developed in two distinct phases:

### Phase 1: DOM-Based Approach (Current)
- **Status**: âœ… Successfully implemented for the easy form
- **Implementation**: Uses Playwright for direct DOM manipulation
- **Scope Decision**: Limited to the easy form only
- **Result**: Successfully captures the "ASTEROID_1" result code

### Phase 2: CUA-Based Approach (Planned)
- **Status**: ðŸ”œ In planning
- **Implementation**: Will use vision-based interactions rather than direct DOM manipulation
- **Scope**: Will aim to handle both easy and hard forms
- **Approach**: More human-like interactions with visual recognition

## DOM Approach Limitations

The current DOM-based approach works well for the easy form but has limitations that became apparent when attempting to automate the hard form:

1. **Brittleness to Form Changes**: Relies on specific CSS selectors and DOM structure
2. **Limited Adaptability**: Requires custom implementation for each form
3. **Lack of Visual Understanding**: Cannot interpret the visual layout or context of elements
4. **Implementation Complexity**: Requires multiple modules and strategies

For a detailed analysis of the DOM approach's strengths and limitations, see [DOM_approach_analysis.md](DOM_approach_analysis.md).

## Project Structure

- `DOM_approach/`: Contains the DOM-based implementation
  - `form_automator.py`: Core automation logic
  - `element_utils.py`: Utilities for finding and interacting with DOM elements
  - `form_schemas.py`: Schemas defining the structure of forms
  - `data_mapper.py`: Maps input data to form fields
  - `config.py`: Configuration settings
  - `main.py`: Entry point for running the automation
- `utils/`: Shared utilities
  - `logger.py`: Logging functionality
- `data_mapping_strategy.md`: Documentation on data mapping approach
- `form_architecture.md`: Documentation on form architecture
- `easy_form_data.json`: Test data for the easy form
- `hard_form_data.json`: Test data for the hard form (not currently used)

## Usage

To run the DOM-based automation for the easy form:

```bash
python DOM_approach/main.py --form easy --data easy_form_data.json --screenshots
```

## Development Notes

- **April 14, 2025**: Successfully implemented the two-step submission process for the easy form
- **April 14, 2025**: Decided to limit the DOM-based approach to the easy form only, as the hard form would require significant additional complexity
- **April 14, 2025**: Focus shifting toward planning the CUA-based approach

## Next Steps

1. Design the architecture for the CUA-based approach
2. Implement vision-based form interaction capabilities
3. Develop a more adaptable form recognition system
4. Test the CUA approach on both easy and hard forms
