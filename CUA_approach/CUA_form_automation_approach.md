# Form Automation with OpenAI Computer Use API

This document outlines the approach for automating form filling using OpenAI's Computer Use API (CUA) with Playwright for browser control.

## Overview

The Computer Use API allows AI models to interact with web interfaces by analyzing screenshots and suggesting actions like clicking, typing, and navigating. This approach leverages CUA to automate the Asteroid form challenge with the following components:

1. **Browser Management**: Using Playwright to control browser interactions
2. **CUA Controller**: Managing conversations with the OpenAI API
3. **Action Execution**: Translating AI suggestions into browser actions
4. **Screenshot Analysis**: Verifying form completion success

## Architecture

### 1. Component Structure

- **ActionHandler**: Executes browser actions (click, type, scroll, etc.)
- **ImageAnalyzer**: Analyzes screenshots for success/failure indicators
- **CUAController**: Orchestrates the CUA conversation loop
- **Main Script**: Initializes components and manages workflow

### 2. Workflow

1. **Initialization**:
   - Launch browser with Playwright
   - Navigate to form URL
   - Capture initial screenshot

2. **Conversation Loop**:
   - Send screenshot and instructions to OpenAI
   - Receive suggested actions
   - Execute actions in the browser
   - Capture new screenshots
   - Repeat until task completion

3. **Result Verification**:
   - Analyze final screenshot for completion code
   - Verify "ASTEROID_1" success indicator

## Implementation Details

### ActionHandler

Handles the execution of different action types:

```python
def execute(self, action):
    action_type = action.type
    
    if action_type == "click":
        x, y = action.x, action.y
        button = action.button if hasattr(action, 'button') else "left"
        self.page.mouse.click(x, y, button=button)
    
    elif action_type == "type":
        text = action.text
        self.page.keyboard.type(text)
    
    # Additional action handlers for scroll, keypress, etc.
```

### ImageAnalyzer

Analyzes screenshots to detect success/failure codes:

```python
def analyze(self, screenshot_path):
    # Extract text using OCR
    text = self._extract_text(screenshot_path)
    
    # Look for success/failure indicators
    if "ASTEROID_1" in text:
        return AnalysisResult(success=True, code="ASTEROID_1")
    elif "ASTEROID_0" in text:
        return AnalysisResult(success=False, code="ASTEROID_0")
```

### CUAController

Manages the conversation with OpenAI's API:

```python
def _run_cua_loop(self, instruction, initial_screenshot):
    # Initial request
    response = self._create_initial_request(instruction, initial_screenshot)
    
    # Main conversation loop
    while turn_count < self.config["max_turns"]:
        # Process computer calls
        computer_call = computer_calls[0]
        
        # Execute the action
        self.action_handler.execute(computer_call.action)
        
        # Take a new screenshot
        screenshot = take_screenshot(self.page)
        
        # Send continuation request
        response = self._create_continuation_request(
            previous_id=response.id,
            call_id=computer_call.call_id,
            screenshot=screenshot
        )
```

## Key Features

1. **Robust Action Handling**:
   - Support for all CUA action types
   - Property validation with hasattr()
   - Comprehensive error handling

2. **Multi-method Image Analysis**:
   - Primary OCR-based text extraction
   - Fallback to OpenAI Vision API
   - Result classification and reporting

3. **Safety and Error Management**:
   - Automatic safety check acknowledgment
   - Timeout and turn limits
   - Screenshot history for debugging

4. **Configurable Parameters**:
   - Browser dimensions
   - Maximum conversation turns
   - Screenshot storage paths

## Technical Requirements

- **Python Dependencies**:
  - openai
  - python-dotenv
  - playwright
  - pytesseract
  - pillow (PIL)

- **Environment Setup**:
  - OpenAI API key
  - Playwright browser installation
  - Tesseract OCR installation

## Advantages of CUA Approach

1. **Adaptability**: CUA can adapt to visual changes in the form
2. **Simplicity**: No need to write complex selectors or DOM traversal
3. **Visual Verification**: Uses visual cues just like a human would
4. **Robustness**: Less brittle than DOM-based approaches

## Limitations

1. **API Costs**: More expensive than pure DOM-based automation
2. **Rate Limits**: Subject to OpenAI's rate limiting
3. **Reliability**: May require multiple attempts for complex interactions
4. **Speed**: Slower than direct DOM manipulation

## Conclusion

The CUA-based approach offers a powerful way to automate form filling with minimal setup. By leveraging OpenAI's visual processing capabilities, it can handle forms without needing detailed knowledge of the underlying DOM structure. This makes it particularly useful for rapid prototyping and situations where the form structure may change over time.
