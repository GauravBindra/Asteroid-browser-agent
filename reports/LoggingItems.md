# Minimal Logging Strategy for Asteroid Form Challenge

This document outlines the bare-minimum logging items that should be captured during form automation. The goal is to record only the most critical events and artifacts to ensure efficient debugging without incurring significant performance or computational overhead.

## Logging Items

1. **Field Filling Actions**  
   - Log each field entry with a clear, concise message (e.g., "Filled First Name with Alice").

2. **Form Submission Event**  
   - Log when the form is submitted along with any resulting status or response code (e.g., "Submitted form, awaiting resultâ€¦").

3. **Discrepancies and Errors**  
   - Log any mismatches between filled values and expected values.  
   - Record any error messages or unexpected events as they occur.

4. **Artifacts Capture**  
   - **Screenshots:**  
     - Capture a screenshot immediately before the form submission.  
     - If submission fails, capture a screenshot after the failure to provide a visual record of the error state.
   - **HTML Content:**  
     - Save the HTML of the page after submission to analyze any server-side validation messages or error details.
5. **Playwright Trace**  
   - Enable Playwright's tracing capabilities to automatically record a detailed trace of all actions during the session.
