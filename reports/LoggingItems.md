# Minimal Logging Strategy for Asteroid Form Challenge

This document outlines the bare-minimum logging items that should be captured during form automation. The goal is to record only the most critical events and artifacts to ensure efficient debugging without incurring significant performance or computational overhead.

## Logging Items

1. **Field Filling Actions**  
   - Log each field entry with a clear, concise message (e.g., "Filled First Name with Alice").

2. **Form Submission Event**  
   - Log when the form is submitted along with any resulting status or response code (e.g., "Submitted form, awaiting result…").

3. **Discrepancies and Errors**  
   - Log any mismatches between filled values and expected values.  
   - Record any error messages or unexpected events as they occur.

4. **Artifacts Capture**  
   - **Screenshots:**  
     - Capture a screenshot immediately before the form submission.  
     - If submission fails, capture a screenshot after the failure to provide a visual record of the error state.
   - **HTML Content:**  
     - Save the HTML of the page after submission to analyze any server-side validation messages or error details.
5. **Playwright Trace**  
   - Enable Playwright's tracing capabilities to automatically record a detailed trace of all actions during the session.  

## Approach

1. **Implementation-Agnostic Design**
   - Single logging interface compatible with both DOM-based and CUA-based approaches
   - Feature detection to adapt to different browser automation frameworks

2. **Structured Output Organization**
   - Session-based directory structure with timestamps
   - Separate subdirectories for screenshots, HTML content, and traces
   - JSON export of all field values for reference and validation

3. **Security and Performance**
   - Automatic redaction of sensitive field values (passwords, tokens)
   - Minimal performance impact through selective artifact capture
   - Asynchronous file operations to prevent blocking the main automation flow

4. **Error Recovery**
   - Capture of error state through screenshots and HTML content
   - Detailed session summary with success/failure status
   - Comprehensive tracing for post-mortem analysis

## Reasoning

When choosing this logging approach, several factors were carefully considered:

- **Simplicity and Efficiency:**  
  The set of logging items is designed to capture the most valuable information while ensuring that the logging process does not become a performance bottleneck. Each log item is intended to provide critical insights without overwhelming the system with unnecessary details.

- **Human-Readable Checkpoints:**  
  Explicit logs (e.g., field filling actions and submission events) provide immediate, human-friendly feedback. This makes it quicker to understand the key actions performed by the agent, as opposed to sifting through lower-level details.

- **Effective Debugging:**  
  Capturing artifacts such as screenshots and HTML snapshots provides visual and structural context. This is especially useful when a discrepancy or error occurs, offering clear evidence of the form’s state at critical moments.

- **Comprehensive Trace with Playwright:**  
  While explicit logs offer targeted insights, the Playwright trace captures a complete record of all low-level interactions, network requests, and DOM changes. This comprehensive trace is invaluable for deep debugging if problems are not evident from the explicit logs alone.

- **Modular and Reusable:**  
  The logging approach is designed to be modular, enabling the same logging mechanism to be reused across different implementations (DOM-based and CUA-based). This ensures consistency and simplifies maintenance across the entire project.

- **Balanced Trade-offs:**  
  By focusing only on critical checkpoints and essential artifacts, this logging strategy strikes a balance between thorough debugging and minimal computational expense. The approach avoids logging overly verbose details unless absolutely necessary.

This approach was chosen after evaluating the need for both high-level summaries (for quick insights) and detailed traces (for in-depth debugging), ensuring that both developers and the evaluation system have the information they need without being overwhelmed by data
