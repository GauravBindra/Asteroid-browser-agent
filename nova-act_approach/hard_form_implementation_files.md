# Hard Form Implementation Files

## Current Progress

We have completed Phase 1 (Core Infrastructure) and started Phase 2 (Section Handlers):

✅ **1. Created hard_form_automation.py skeleton**
   - Created both hard_form_automation.py and hard_form_automation3_corrected.py
   - Successfully imported necessary functions from form_automation_working.py
   - Added baseline automate_hard_form placeholder function

✅ **2. Implemented select_dropdown_option()**
   - Developed and optimized for performance with single combined commands
   - Successfully tested with Title dropdown
   - Added robust error handling and fallback approach

✅ **3. Implemented fill_date_field()**
   - Created with format conversion (YYYY-MM-DD to DD/MM/YYYY)
   - Added clear format instructions in commands
   - Incorporated fallback for alternative format (MM/DD/YYYY)
   - Successfully tested with Date of Birth field

✅ **4. Implemented navigate_to_tab()**
   - Created with conditional scroll-and-click navigation pattern
   - Successfully tested with all form sections
   - Added robust error handling and fallback approach
   - Used improved command structure based on testing results

✅ **5. Implemented click_next_button()**
   - Developed sequential navigation functionality
   - Added scroll-to-find approach for button visibility
   - Included clear waiting instructions for section transitions
   - Added robust error handling with fallback mechanism

✅ **6. Implemented fill_contact_details()**
   - First section handler implementation
   - Handles all fields in the Contact Details section
   - Incorporates conditional logic for joint insured fields
   - Ends by proceeding to the next section using click_next_button()
   - Combines all previous functions into a cohesive section handler

➡️ **Next Step:** Implement fill_business_info() function (Phase 2: Section Handlers, Step 2)

## Key Learnings Applied

- Followed Nova-ACT best practices from official GitHub examples
- Combined multiple steps into single commands for efficiency
- Used explicit natural language instructions
- Removed redundant verification steps
- Added appropriate error handling

## File Structure

### 1. main_working_hard.py (New file, not yet implemented)
- Based on existing main_working.py
- Will import and use hard_form_automation_corrected.py
- Added support for hard form automation
- CLI argument handling for hard form option

### 2. form_automation_working.py (Existing file, unchanged)
- Kept as is with current easy form functionality
- Successfully importing from this file:
  - fill_text_field()
  - handle_checkbox()
  - click_button()
  - wait_for_form_load()
  - extract_result_code()
  - submit_form()

### 3. hard_form_automation6.py (Current implementation)
- Successfully imports and reuses functions from form_automation_working.py
- Implemented core utility functions:
  - select_dropdown_option() - Optimized for dropdown handling ✅
  - fill_date_field() - With format handling ✅
  - navigate_to_tab() - With improved conditional commands ✅
  - click_next_button() - With scroll-to-find approach ✅
- Section-specific handlers:
  - fill_contact_details() - First section implementation ✅
  - fill_business_info() - To be implemented next ⏳
  - fill_premises_details() ⏳
  - fill_security_safety() ⏳
  - fill_coverage_options() ⏳
- automate_hard_form() (placeholder implemented, to be expanded) ⏳

### 4. utils_final.py (Existing file, unchanged)
- Successfully using for logging and data loading
- No changes needed

## Implementation Plan (Remaining Steps)

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (✅ Completed)
4. **Implement navigate_to_tab() and click_next_button()** ✅
   - Functions for multi-section navigation
   - Test: Navigate between different form sections
   - Created test_navigation4.py and test_navigation5.py for testing
   - Applied improved commands and error handling

### Phase 2: Section Handlers (Building Incrementally)
5. **Implement fill_contact_details()** ✅ 
   - First section implementation 
   - Test: Fill just contact section and click Next
   - Created test_contact6.py for testing
   - Applied official Nova-ACT best practices

6. **Implement fill_business_info()**
   - Second section implementation
   - Test: Navigate to business section and fill it

7. **Implement fill_premises_details()**
   - Third section with conditional fields
   - Test: Navigate to premises section and fill it

8. **Implement fill_security_safety()**
   - Fourth section with complex field handling
   - Test: Navigate to security section and fill it

9. **Implement fill_coverage_options()**
   - Final section of the form
   - Test: Navigate to coverage section and fill it

### Phase 3: Integration
10. **Implement automate_hard_form() orchestrator**
    - Main function to call all section handlers
    - Test: Run through entire form

11. **Create main_working_hard.py**
    - Update CLI for hard form support
    - Test: Execute complete hard form automation from CLI

## Testing Approach

For each implementation step, we create a corresponding test file:
- test_dropdown3_corrected.py - Test file for dropdown and date functions (steps 1-3) ✅
- test_navigation4.py - Test file for tab navigation function (step 4-part 1) ✅
- test_navigation5.py - Test file for next button function (step 4-part 2) ✅
- test_contact6.py - Test file for contact details section handler (step 5) ✅
- Next test file will be for testing business info section handler ⏳

## Thought Process for select_dropdown_option() Function

Purpose:
- Handle dropdown/select fields that aren't present in the easy form
- Provide a reliable way to select from options in a dropdown menu
- Work with various dropdown types in the hard form (Title, Business Type, Listed Status, etc.)

Considerations:
1. Reliable Selection:
  - Dropdowns can be implemented differently (native select, custom JS components)
  - Need approach that works with both standard and custom dropdowns
  - Nova-ACT needs clear instructions to identify and interact with dropdowns
2. Error Handling:
  - What if dropdown doesn't exist or can't be found?
  - What if requested option doesn't exist?
  - Need robust error handling and logging
3. Timing Issues:
  - Option lists may load dynamically
  - Need to wait appropriately after clicking to open dropdown
  - Need to ensure selection is complete before proceeding
4. Verification:
  - How to verify selection was successful?
  - Consider reading selected value after action
5. Natural Language Command:
  - How to phrase the command for Nova-ACT to understand clearly?
  - Need to be specific enough for reliable execution

Implementation Approach:
- Use Nova-ACT's natural language capabilities with a clear, specific command
- Include appropriate waiting periods for UI interactions
- Log all steps and potential issues
- Follow the same error handling pattern as other functions
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
