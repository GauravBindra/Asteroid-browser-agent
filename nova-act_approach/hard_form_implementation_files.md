## Recent Improvements (Version 9)

We've made significant improvements to address the outstanding issues:

1. **Enhanced Text Field Handling**
   - Created new enhanced_fill_text_field() function with multiple fallback strategies
   - Added 3 progressively more aggressive fallback approaches for difficult fields
   - Implemented special handling for the Joint Insured Person Name field 
   - Added higher retry count (5 vs. default 3) for problematic fields

2. **Fixed Verification Process**
   - Implemented section-specific verification that doesn't navigate away
   - Added explicit instructions to not click buttons or navigate
   - Improved verification to check specific fields by name
   - Focused verification command to only check current section

3. **Improved Field Value Persistence**
   - Added specific confirmation steps after field entry
   - Enhanced commands to explicitly save values
   - Added post-fill verification to ensure values remain

4. **Better Maximum Steps Handling**
   - Simplified commands to stay within step limits
   - Added special handling for fields that consistently exceed step limit
   - Split complex operations into multiple separate commands

5. **Enhanced Field Targeting Precision**
   - Added "click precisely in the center of the input field" instructions
   - Improved targeting to avoid edge-clicking issues
   - Documented this important finding in nova-act_bestpractices.md

6. **Automated Recovery for Stuck Fields**
   - Implemented scroll_reset mechanism to help the agent recover when stuck
   - Added coordinate tracking to detect when agent repeatedly tries the same location
   - Triggers viewport reset after 8+ attempts at the same coordinates
   - Clears the agent's visual context to help it "see" the form differently

7. **Force Coordinate Re-evaluation on Each Attempt**
   - Added "IMPORTANT: Discard any previous coordinates and assumptions" instruction
   - Forces agent to "look at the page with fresh eyes" on each fallback attempt
   - Prevents the static coordinate reuse problem observed in problematic fields
   - Combats Nova-ACT's tendency to reuse the same coordinates after failure

## Identified Problems and Solutions

### Static Coordinate Reuse Problem

We identified a fundamental issue with how Nova-ACT handles failed field interactions:

1. **Problem Description**:
   - When an agent tries to interact with a field and fails, it tends to reuse the exact same coordinates on subsequent attempts
   - This is clearly visible in the logs where the agent repeatedly tries `<box>408,408,438,876</box>` coordinates 20+ times
   - Each attempt shows identical thinking: "The page has not changed, so my last action was not successful..."
   - Instead of re-analyzing the page to find better coordinates, it gets stuck in a loop

2. **Root Cause**:
   - Nova-ACT agent's default behavior is to remember and reuse previously identified coordinates
   - When field interaction fails, it doesn't automatically discard those coordinates
   - It lacks instruction to "look with fresh eyes" on subsequent attempts
   - This is particularly problematic for hard-to-target fields like Joint Insured Person Name

3. **Solution Implemented**:
   - Added explicit "Discard previous coordinates and assumptions" instructions to every fallback
   - Force agent to "look at the page with fresh eyes and re-examine the form layout" on each attempt
   - This creates a fresh analysis of the page layout on each try, rather than reusing old coordinates

4. **Expected Impact**:
   - Agent should now try different coordinates on each attempt rather than repeating the same ones
   - This should especially help with problematic fields like Joint Insured Person Name
   - Increases chances of successful interaction by exploring more potential field locations

## Remaining Issues to Monitor

While we've made significant improvements, we should continue to monitor:

1. **Joint Insured Person Name Field**
   - Coordinate re-evaluation should help, but verify this field works consistently
   - If issues persist, consider direct Playwright interaction as last resort

2. **Multi-Section Navigation**
   - As we implement more sections, watch for section transition issues
   - May need additional handling for back/forward navigation

✅ **6. Implemented fill_business_info()**
   - Second section handler implementation
   - Handles all fields in the Business Info section
   - Special handling for address fields with placeholders
   - Added fallbacks for fields that might have different labels
   - Handles conditional ERN tax code exemption
   - Ends by proceeding to the next section using click_next_button()
   - Includes verification step to check all filled fields
   - Created in version 11 of the implementation

✅ **7. Enhanced implementation with semantic field detection**
   - Created field_exists() function for semantic field lookup
   - Adds resilience against discrepancies between JSON data model and actual form
   - Performs bounded scroll probe to find fields not initially in view
   - Gracefully handles missing fields without failing
   - Tries multiple field names and labels for each data point
   - Created in version 12 of the implementation

➡️ **Next Step:** Implement fill_premises_details() function (Phase 2: Section Handlers, Step 3)

## Thought Process for select_dropdown_option() Function

Purpose:
- Handle dropdown/select fields that aren't present in the easy form
- Provide a reliable way to select from options in a dropdown menu
- Work with various dropdown types in the hard form (Title, Business Type, Listed Status, etc.)

Considerations:
1. Reliable Selection:
  - Dropdowns can be implemented differently (native select, custom JS components)
  - Need approach that works with both standard and custom dropdowns
  - Nova-ACT needs clear instructions to identify and interact with dropdowns
2. Error Handling:
  - What if dropdown doesn't exist or can't be found?
  - What if requested option doesn't exist?
  - Need robust error handling and logging
3. Timing Issues:
  - Option lists may load dynamically
  - Need to wait appropriately after clicking to open dropdown
  - Need to ensure selection is complete before proceeding
4. Verification:
  - How to verify selection was successful?
  - Consider reading selected value after action
5. Natural Language Command:
  - How to phrase the command for Nova-ACT to understand clearly?
  - Need to be specific enough for reliable execution

Implementation Approach:
- Use Nova-ACT's natural language capabilities with a clear, specific command
- Include appropriate waiting periods for UI interactions
- Log all steps and potential issues
- Follow the same error handling pattern as other functions
- Maintain consistency with existing code style
