# Hard Form Additional Functionalities Needed

1. **Multi-Section Navigation**
   - Functions to navigate between form tabs/sections
   - Ability to track current section and handle "Next" buttons

2. **Complex Field Types**
   - Dropdown select handling (for Title, Business Type, etc.)
   - Date field formatting (different from easy form)
   - Address field handling (multiple components) 
   - Textarea support for longer text fields

3. **Conditional Field Logic**

   - Waiting for conditional fields to become visible

4. **Nested Data Structure Handling**
   - Navigation of the hierarchical JSON structure
   - Mapping nested data to appropriate form fields

5. **Section-Specific Processing**
   - Contact details section handler
   - Business info section handler
   - Premises details section handler
   - Security & safety section handler
   - Coverage options section handler
